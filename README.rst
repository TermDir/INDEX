Purpose
=======

This project aims to compile directories of open source projects that run in
terminal, to help people discover projects.

They are manually curated, publishing on GitHub (not Pages).  They are not just
lists of names and links, they would contain key information regarding the
projects with descriptions, and perhaps screenshots if necessary.


Criteria for Inclusion
======================

There are strict criteria for the projects to be included in the directories:

* Must be over one year old
* Must be open source or in public domain
* Must either support English or can be used without difficulties regardless
  the languages users speak
* Must have the following notability criteria:

  * Must receive reasonable coverage


Directories

Currently only indexing *Eye Candies* as the pilot directory.

* `Eye Candies <https://github.com/TermDir/EyeCandies>`_ make your terminal
  look cool for screenshots!
