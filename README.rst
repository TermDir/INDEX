Purpose
=======

This project aims to compile directories of open source projects that run in
terminal, to help people discover projects.

They are manually curated, publishing on GitHub (not Pages).  They are not just
lists of names and links, they would contain key information regarding the
projects with descriptions, and perhaps screenshots if necessary.


Criteria for Inclusion
======================

There are strict criteria for the projects to be included in the directories:

* Must be over one year old
* Must be open source or in public domain
* Must be able to be run and understood by users who only speak English


Directories
===========

Currently only indexing *Eye Candies* as the pilot directory.

* `Eye Candies <https://github.com/TermDir/EyeCandies>`_ make your terminal
  look cool for screenshots!
